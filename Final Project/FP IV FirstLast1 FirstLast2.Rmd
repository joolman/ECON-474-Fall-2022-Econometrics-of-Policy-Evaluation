# **[30 Points]** Research Design
********************************************************************************

This section is centered around understanding the research design for this paper.

## **[10 Points]** Research Question
************************************************************

What is the research question of this paper?

*Hint: economists are notorious for not explicitly stating their research question in their papers.*

**Your answer:**



## **[20 Points]** Empirical Design
************************************************************

1. What is the casual technique of this paper, and why is it chosen?

**Your answer:**


2. Name one possible threat to identification.

**Your answer:**


# **[70 Points]**  Replication
********************************************************************************

The paper estimates the regression:

$$ln(P_{i,t}) = \alpha_{0,t} + \alpha_{1,t} \widehat{ln(T_i)} + \alpha_{2,t} ln(X_i) + \alpha_{3,t} \Gamma_i + \alpha_{4,t} D_i + \epsilon_{i,t}$$
$$ln(T_i) = \rho_{0,t} + \rho_{1,t} Z_i + \rho_{2,t} ln(X_i) + \rho_{3,t} \Gamma_i + \rho_{4,t} D_i + \xi_{i,t}$$

separately for different years $t$, where $i$ is the modern day country.

The mapping of the variables in the regression to the data are:

- $P_{i,1500}$ - `ln_pd1500` (population density in 1500 CE)
- $T_i$ - `ln_yst` (years since neolithic period)
- $X_i$ - `pc_lnar_lnas` (land productivity)
- $\Gamma_i$ - geographical controls for country $i$
    - `ln_abs_lat` - absolute latitude
    - `distcr1000` - mean distance to nearest coast or river
    - `land100cr` - percentage of land within 100 km of coast or river
- $D_i$ - `continent`
- $Z_i$ - instruments
    - `animals` - number of domesticable animals species
    - `plants` - number of domesticable plants species

## **[30 Points]** Table 2: Population Density in 1500 CE
************************************************************

Here you are going to somewhat replicate a modified table 2.
Specifically, you are going to replicate columns 5 and 6 and add the reduced form estimates.
There is a typo in the paper's code, so your estimates will be slightly different but the number of observations will be the same.
For some guidance, the OLS estimate on `ln_yst` should be 1.375, the RF estimate on `animals` should be 0.0659, and the 2SLS estimate on `ln_yst` should be 2.051.

For each regression, use the subset of the data where `cleanhibbs == 1` and use heteroskedastic robust standard errors.

Put all three regressions into an `etable()`.
Rename all variables appropriately (recall you cannot rename the cluster variable).
Specify the `fitstat` argument to match.

```{r tab2}

## **[35 Points]** Frisch-Waugh-Lovell - Figure 3b
************************************************************


Use the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem to plot the partial relationship between `ln_pd1500` and `pc_lnar_lnas` with `ggplot()` using the OLS regression from above, but with the subset of the data `cleanpd1500 == 1`.
Set the scatter plot point type to represent the continents, and use `geom_text()` to label all of the points with country `code`s.
Label the axes and title appropriately. 

*Hint: get the variables* `code` *and* `continent` *from the matching subset of the original data set.*
